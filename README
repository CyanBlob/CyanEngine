Work in progress
CyanBlob's basic game engine, using OpenGL and Freeglut3. This is first and
foremost a learning experience for me. I am writing the entire game+engine
myself, without looking up anything except documentation (no examples or best-
practices), and with using as few external dependencies.
Aside from the threading used, this compiles+runs on Windows, as long as
the depencies are set up properly. My primary focus is the Linux build.

Compilation and running:
g++ *.cpp -o CyanEngine.out -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lSOIL -lpthread -std=c++11
./CyanEngine

Dependencies:
openGL
freeGLUT 3.0
SOIL (http://lonesock.net/soil.html) (to be removed later)

Current features:
Collision detection (and onCollisionEnter functions)
Procedural dungeon generation
Sprite rendering
Player movement
Basic attack

Upcoming features:
Better attacks
Binding of Isaac style upgrades (on-hit, on-attack etc. improvements from items)
Enemies
Animation
